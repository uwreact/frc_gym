Initial testing environment based on[Banna Gym](https://github.com/MartinThoma/banana-gym). You are selling bananas one at a time, which spoil within a period of 3 days. The probability that you will sell the banana is given by:
![Alt Text](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%24%24p%28x%29%20%3D%5Cfrac%7B1&plus;e%7D%7B%201%20&plus;%20e%5E%7B%28x&plus;1%29%7D%7D%24%24)
